The community centre has been awarded a grant under the 2020-21 Crown Reserves Improvement Fund program.
This grant will allow us to construct a wheelchair accessible toilet building with a commercial grade composting toilet. The project will deliver sanitary facilities that are comparable to what is available in National Parks and accessible to community members with special mobility needs. This will greatly improve the amenity of the reserve for community members.
