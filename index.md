# Welcome to the Mount Burrell Comunity Centre

## About Us

The Community Centre is at 214 Mount Burrell Rd and has been managed by a group of local volunteers since the late 1980's. It sits on community land that was home to the old Mount Burrell (or Gooninbah) Public School from 1915 until it closed in 1963.
The centre is used for gatherings and celebrations. 
Working bees are usually held on the first Saturday of the month and we have a weekly "Wind Down Friday" starting at 5:30 pm which is open to everybody to mark the end of the week, have a yarn or play card and board games.
